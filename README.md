# Jarvis-Voice-Assistant
When I was a kid, I watch a movie named Iron man and in this movie a voice assistant named Jarvis performed many tasks on voice command given by the user. I was really fascinated by that. I was taken aback when Google and Amazon launched their voice assistant and want to know about that how this whole system work? How on giving just a command in a simpler language it perform the task without any error? Google launched Google Home as their voice assistant and Amazon launched Alexa as their voice assistant. So, I want to know more about that and I accept this project as a challenge to make a voice assistant which can work on giving simpler voice command in English language. My simple objective is to reduce work load on user. As in todayâ€™s life we want to perform multiple task at the same time and as technology is increasing day by day so if we want that we just give a voice command to perform some operations then it will be very helpful for us. For instance, if we are busy in other work and we want to play music and want that we just give a voice command so that we can play a music or something else. Then it will be very helpful.
